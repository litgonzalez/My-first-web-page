# About this webpage

I made this web page to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the web programming course with Python. It is a web page where you can register and make a fictitious purchase order in my brother's business (@ 3dhub.ar).

On the main page, the 3d prints that have been made are displayed, and after registering, you can order in the "purchase" section where you can choose the product you want.

After finalizing the order, it takes you to a page where all the orders are displayed with the name of the client and the items that he decided to choose, as well as the price of each one.

I made this webpage using the following technologies:

- Django / Python
- JavaScript
- CSS / Bootstrap
- SQlite
